\section{Introduction to Document} \label{sec:intro}
\subsection{Purpose of the Product} \label{sec:purpose}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{0pt}
\textit{Knightingale} is a \textit{Twitter} analytics tool. Whether it's helping businesses better figure out to whom to market their products, aiding clinical psychologists understand the impact of social media on anxiety disorders, or making navigating \textit{Twitter} easier for young adults, \textit{Knightingale} is intended for all users. \newline

\noindent The \textit{Software Design Document} is intended principally for the development team and their professor at \textit{Allegheny College}, \textit{Dr. Gregory Kapfhammer}. This document provides a description of the functions of \textit{Knightingale} at a low-level of detail.

\subsection{Document Conventions} \label{sec:conventions}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{0pt}
This document was written following \textit{IEEE} conventions. It was formatted with \LaTeX. This is the most low-level of the trio of documents; the architecture document is at a higher level of description, and the requirements document is more concerned with the high-level concepts and expectations of the procuct. \newline

\noindent Names, classes, and methods will be italicized, and both numbers and variables are modified with the $\$$ wrapper in \LaTeX.

\section{System Overview} \label{sec:overview}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{0pt}
\textit{Knightingale} was, at least in theory, conceived by \textit{Dr. Gregory Kapfhammer} at \textit{Allegheny College}. He assigned the creation of the system to the students in his \textit{Computer Science} $290$ \textit{Principles of Software Development} class as their final project. Four teams of five students would each develop their own \textit{Twitter} analytics system. \textit{Knightingale} is one of those systems. \newline

\noindent What sets \textit{Knightingale} apart from its competition is its user-friendly interface, modularity, and expandability. The Knightingale command-line interface is exceptionally easy to use for any user with a basic background in command-line tools, and a \texit{Swing} graphical user interface is planned as well. The structiure of the system makes it very easy to add new features and other components at any point in time. \newline

\noindent To further develop an example given in Section $1.1$, consider the situation of a clinical psychologist. It is common knowledge that a person's use of social media can be linked to their loneliness. The clinical psychologist might use the metrics provided by \textit{Knightingale} to better understand her client. Another example concerns a person engaged in social-media marketing for their company on Twitter. Such an individual could easily make use of \textit{Knightingale} to collect information about their company's Twitter feed to improve their marketing efforts or communicate information to their colleagues.

\section{Data Design} \label{sec:datadesign}
\subsection{Data Description} \label{sec:datadescript}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{0pt}
\texit{Knightingale} stores a user's \texit{Twitter} archive over long periods using a \texit{SQLite 3} relational database. The Database package is used to provide a single point of interface with this database through which other components of the system must interact with the database.\newline

The information domain of \textit{Knightingale} is the \textit{.ZIP} file downloaded from \textit{Twitter}, as well as information pulled directly from \textit{Twitter} through the \textit{Twitter4j} API. When the user adds a new twitter archive to the \textit{Knightingale} system, the Parser package is used to extract tweets from the archive file, which may then be discarded. The Database package is then used to insert these tweets into the SQLite 3 relational database. The database automatically generates a separate table of Twitter user IDs by selecting all of the unique user ID values that appear in the Tweets database. This table represents all of the Twitter users known by the system. These IDs are then associated with \twitter{Twitter} user names through communication with the \textit{Twitter} API.

- Go through classes
- What are the methods and what do they do?

In this section, we take a closer look at what each component does in a more systematic way. 
Describe any local data when necessary.

\section{Human Interface Design} \label{sec:human}
\subsection{Overview of User Interface} \label{sec:ui}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{0pt}
\texit{Knightingale}'s primary point of contact with the user is a command-line interface, although a Swing graphical user interface is a planned feature. The user may interact with the system using a series of command-line arguments to the \texttt{knightingale} command.
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{search <search term>}: search for all tweets with a word
\item \texttt{refresh}: get new tweets for the user from Twitter's servers
\item \texttt{add <path to archive>}: adds tweets from the archive with the specified path to the database
\item \texttt{delete}: removes all user data from the database
\item \texttt{frequency <type: replies | hashtags | retweets>}: performs frequency analysis on replied users, retweeted users, or hashtags, depending on the argument given
\item \texttt{composition}: returns information about the percent composition of the user's tweets
\item \texttt{cloud <type: replies | hashtags | retweets>}: generates cloud visualizations for the chosen global frequency
\end{itemize}
Additional visualizations, such as ASCII graphs for users in command-line only environments, bar charts and pie charts for displaying compositional data, and heatmaps for displaying geolocational data, are all planned features for \textit{Knightingale}, and the modular architecture that the system uses for visualizations makes the addition of these and other visualizatyion types very easy.
